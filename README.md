# News-Finder

Created a mobile application that returns any news article based on input from a user. First screen requires users to either login or register. Logins will work if they have already logged in previously and their information has been stored on Firebase. To register, users enter a username and then type and retype a password to confirm they match. Once an account has been generated, users will be prompted to narrow their news search by entering their preferences for country, query, language, category, domain, and page count. Once each fragment has been accessed, a custom adapter list of up to 50 news articles with the user's preferences will be generated. Each article will have a hyperlink, date published, and a short description of the article. All of this information is accessed using the NewsAPI. Users can like articles that will be added to a "Favorites" section and can be accessed anytime, across multiple logins.
